  <!-- Imagine you're designing a responsive dashboard layout using CSS Grid. You need to create a grid where the first column always remains 250 pixels wide, the last column takes up the remaining space with a minimum width of 200 pixels, and the middle column should flexibly distribute the remaining available space proportionally. How would you structure your CSS Grid to achieve this layout, ensuring it works seamlessly across different screen sizes? -->
