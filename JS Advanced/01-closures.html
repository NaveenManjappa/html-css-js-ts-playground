  <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-loose mb-6 px-2">A closure is a function that can access and remember its lexical scope (the variables and parameters in its outer function) even after the outer function has finished executing. It's essentially a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state, allowing it to "remember" the environment in which it was created.</p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-loose mb-6 px-2">
    At its heart, a closure is about a function remembering the environment (the lexical scope, its "backpack" ðŸŽ’ or "bubble" ðŸ«§) in which it was created. This allows an inner function to access variables from its outer function(s) even after those outer functions have finished executing.

This "memory" is not just a passive copy; it's a live link, enabling powerful patterns like data privacy, function factories, and reliable callbacks.
